This is for the Sonatus Coderbyte challenge.

I implemented using threads for the customers and baristas. If I had more time, I could have improved this by using condition variables rather than continuously 
waiting threads for better efficiency.

You can change global variables in Main.cpp and coffeeshop.cpp to change behavior of this simulation. It should work with any reasonable quantities.

I did not have time to set up input validation. Please only use inputs that are positive integers for expected results.
